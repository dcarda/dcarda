### About Me

I consider myself a life-long learner with a heavy bent toward technology and solutions.  I'm a Java/J2EE Developer/Architect by trade, and have been active in the professional development community since 1983.  If you'd like to review my career you can check out my resume at my personal website (currently under construction):

I started programming in 1979 while still in High School.  The school had purchased a TRS-80 Model I.  This machine didn't even have disk drives and used an external tape drive as storage.  I self taught myself TRS Basic and programed a version of Star Trek and was hooked from that point on.

During college I graduated to a Honeywell 6000 w/EIS mainframe.  I found it to be a fertile ground for hacking!  ðŸ˜„

I started my professional career at the same time the Micro Computer Revolution started.  (I even worked on the original IBM PC (single 360k floppy drive).  I've seen a lot of change over these decades.  Some good, some not so good.
