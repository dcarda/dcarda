### About Me

I consider myself a life-long learner with a heavy bent toward technology.  I'm a Java/J2EE Programer/Architect by trade, and have been active in the professional development community since 1983.  If you'd like to review my career you can check out my resume here:

I started programming in 1979 while still in High School.  The school had purchased a TRS-80 Model I.  This machine didn't even have disk drives and used an external tape drive as storage.  I programed a version of Star Trek and was hooked from that point on.

Though I do have a wide varity of interestes.
